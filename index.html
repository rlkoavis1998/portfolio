       <h2>Things About Me:</h2>
        <p>I am a 26 (soon to be 27) year old Environmental Engineering Dropout. I'm currently living in Bodrum, a touristic seaside town in the Aegean part of Turkey. I can do so much things: Drawing with AutoCAD, making music with various DAW's (currently trying to get one), make a website from scratch with HTML5, CSS and JavaScript. Nowadays I'm studying remotely in Istanbul University for Political Science and Public Administration but in any trade or job, I want to do things differently, efficiently and creatively. I currently have three books that are live in Google Play Books, and the fourth one will come eventually.</p>
