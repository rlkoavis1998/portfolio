 <h1>Berdan's Best Movies</h1>
 <hr/>
<h2>My top three movies of all time.</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Tron Legacy (2011)</h3>
<p>One of the most un-Disney Disney movies of all time. A great tale about family, mistakes, perfection, fascism and redemption. Oh, it's also in a supercomputer too.</p>
<h3>Star Wars Episode III:Revenge of The Sith (2005)</h3>
<p>An epic hero's downfall story set in a galaxy that is torn apart by a long and destructive civil war, wrapped within the story of how a republic can turn into a monarchy. It also has lightsabers.</p>
<h3>Dune (2021) and Dune:Part Two (2023)</h3>
<p>I know, those are two movies but considering the story they tell, seeing them as one long movie makes a lot of sense. It's a lengthy but magnificent story about freedom, war, love, lineage and religious propaganda. It is a blueprint of how idolization of persons can lead people to their downfall.</p>
